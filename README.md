1. [Download Godot 4.2.1](https://godotengine.org/)
2. [Download and Install Blender 3.6](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/3-6/) (this is needed even if you personally never plan on opening Blender)
3. [Download and Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. [Download and Install Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) (skip this step if you are using GitHub Desktop).
   - Make sure to run `git lfs install`
5. Open up a new Godot Project. In the top left, navigate `Editor > Editor Settings`, then filter for `Blender`, and under `FileSystem > Import` set `Blender 3 Path`. This is required so that the models import correctly.

6. `git clone https://github.com/dignitydignity/easter-jam-2024.git`

You should now be able to open up and run the project. Test by opening it up and then pressing `f5` once the initial load/importing is finished.
